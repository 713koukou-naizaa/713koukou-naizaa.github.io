                Memoris: Recollection is a fantasy 2D RPG that I've been working on with a friend since May 2024. It was at this time both our largest project ever, but it allowed me to acquire experience in a lot of domains:
                <ul>
                    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>LaTeX</li>

                        In order to share our projects, keep tabs of all the changes we did as well as saving the different versions of our work, we used GitHub and Git. At first we created a conception branch in which we put all of the documents, and we created a GitHub project to use the integrated backlog.

                        Due to the large amount of information, my friend and I needed organized documents in order to keep track of the history, lore, character information... Therefore, we did some research on how to organize the documents of a game and what was a game design document.
