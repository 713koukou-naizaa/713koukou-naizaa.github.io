                Memoris: Recollection is a fantasy 2D RPG that I've been working on with a friend since May 2024. It was at the time both our largest project ever and provides me with valuable experience in many domains, while also offering opportunities to expand my skills in new areas as the project progresses and we tackle down more and more tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>LaTeX</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                        In order to share our projects, keep tabs of all the changes we did as well as saving the different versions of our work, we used GitHub and Git. At first we created a conception branch in which we put all of the documents, and we created a GitHub project to use the integrated backlog.

                        We plan to use Unity to create our game, even though I already have some basis, it will enhance my knowledge of Unity editor : I'll work with scenes, components, write the scripts using UnityEngine and make animations.

                        Using Unity, I'll gain more experience with C# : we already thought about how to implement some classes and plan to use interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism (mostly for the characters, players, monsters...).

                        While we were at it, we decided to use LaTeX to write all the documents of our project. We first used Overleaf online but later switched to Visual Studio Code when we started versionning the documents on GitHub.
