                Memoris: Recollection is a fantasy 2D RPG that I've been working on with a friend since May 2024. It was at this time both our largest project ever, but it allowed me to acquire experience in a lot of domains:
                <ul>
                    <li>C# with Unity</li>
                    <li>Documents production</li>
                    <li>LaTeX</li>
                    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <section class="dark-main-title2-section">
                <div class="dark-main-title2">C# with Unity</div>
                <p class="dark-main-paragraph">
                    This project helped me to acquire experience in C# : I was able to use interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism. I also learned how to use the Unity editor : I worked with scenes, components, wrote the scripts using UnityEngine and made animations.
                </p>
                
                <div class="dark-main-title2">Documents production</div>
                <p class="dark-main-paragraph">
                    Due to the large amount of information, my friend and I needed organized documents in order to keep track of the history, lore, character information... Therefore, we did some research on how to organize the documents of a game and what was a game design document.
                </p>

                <div class="dark-main-title2">LaTeX</div>
                <p class="dark-main-paragraph">
                    While we were at it, we decided to use LaTeX to write all the documents of our project. We first used Overleaf online but later switched to Visual Studio Code when we started versionning the documents on GitHub.
                </p>
                
                <div class="dark-main-title2">Git and GitHub</div>
                <p class="dark-main-paragraph">
                    In order to share our projects, keep tabs of all the changes we did as well as saving the different versions of our work, we used GitHub and Git. At first we created a conception branch in which we put all of the documents.
