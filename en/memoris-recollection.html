                Memoris: Recollection is a fantasy 2D RPG that I've been working on with a friend since May 2024. It was at the time both our largest project ever and provides me with valuable experience in many domains, while also offering opportunities to expand my skills in new areas as the project progresses, and we tackle down more and more tasks:

                        In order to share our projects, keep tabs on all the changes we made, and save the different versions of our work, we used GitHub and Git. At first, we created a conception branch in which we put all the documents, and we created a GitHub project to use the integrated backlog.

                        We plan to use Unity to create our game, even though I already have some basis. It will enhance my knowledge of Unity Editor: I'll work with scenes and components, write the scripts using Unity Engine and make animations.
