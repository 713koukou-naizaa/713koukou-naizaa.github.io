                This Python app was made to learn more about image processing and various famous algorithms such as near neighbor, bilinear interpolation, and Lanczos resampling. It is why the algorithms used in the program are not the built-in ones offered by Python libraries like cv2 but hand-made algorithms reproduced after I studied them.

                        Nearest Neighbor is the first algorithm I implemented. I started with a version that felt slow, but once I tried to optimize it, I realized I could avoid computations inside nested loops. The first screenshot is the version pre-optimization; the second one is the version post-optimization.

                            Mirroring an image is the second function implemented; this time I was able to avoid unnecessary computation from the start thanks to my previous experience with the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. I implemented vertical, horizontal, and vertical + horizontal mirroring; the algorithm is basically the same for all of them; here is the vertical mirroring one.
